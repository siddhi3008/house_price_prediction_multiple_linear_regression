# House Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting house prices using the Multiple Linear Regression model. The goal is to develop an accurate and reliable model that estimates house prices based on various independent variables.

**The project follows a systematic workflow**:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant information about houses, including features like size, number of bedrooms, location, and amenities that influence house prices.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure it is in a suitable format for analysis.

3. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most important features that have a significant impact on house prices. This can be done using statistical techniques or domain knowledge.

4. **Splitting Data**: Divide the dataset into a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to train the Multiple Linear Regression model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

5. **Multiple Linear Regression Model**: Train the model using the training data, assuming a linear relationship between the independent variables and house prices. Find the best-fitting line that represents this relationship.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared. These metrics measure how well the model predicts house prices.

7. **Predicting House Prices**: Utilize the trained model to estimate house prices for new, unseen data. Input the independent variables and obtain corresponding price estimates.

8. **Model Interpretation**: Interpret the coefficients associated with each independent variable in the Multiple Linear Regression model. These coefficients represent the change in house prices for a one-unit change in the respective independent variable.

9. **Model Improvement**: If necessary, enhance the model's performance through techniques like feature engineering, exploring different regression algorithms, addressing nonlinear relationships, or incorporating regularization techniques.

This project aims to create a reliable house price prediction model using the Multiple Linear Regression approach. It involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, interpretation, and potential model improvements.
